# Power-Bi-Dashboard--Healthcare-Data-Analysis
# In this project, i have tried to analyse the healthcare data mainly comprising of patient wait list of both inpatients and outpatients of a hospital. This dashboard provides a comprehensive summary of waiting lists and case types across medical specialties.
# Project Goals:
# 1. Track current status  of patient waiting list
# 2. Analyse historical monthly trends of waiting list in inpatient and outpatient categories.
# 3. Detailed specialty level and age profile analysis.
# Metrics Used:
# 1. Average and median waiting list
# 2. Current total wait list
# Insights drawn:
# 1. Current Waitlist(790k) has increased by 69k compared to Last Year(640k). This indicates an approx. 10.8% rise in patient backlog which may need capacity planning or policy intervention.
# 2. Outpatient cases dominate the list with 72.49%, followed by:
# Day Case: 16.89%
# Inpatient: 10.62%
# Prioritization strategies may be needed for Inpatients and Day Cases which often require more intensive care.
# 3. Most patients have been waiting for 0-3 months and 18+ months forming the two largest segments.
# 4. Outpatient numbers increased sharply from 500k in early 2018 to 629k in 2021. A significant surge started in mid 2019, peaked in July 2020(629k), possibly pandemic related.
# Conclusion:
# This analysis uncovers rising healthcare demands with outpatient cases and cardiology wait times being areas of concern. Strategic efforts should focus on reducing long-term waits(especially 18+ months), expanding outpatient care capacity and addressing bottlenecks in specialties like cardiology and anasthetics.
# Through this project i have gained hands on experience with preparing real-world healthcare data. Used tools like Power Query for handling datasets, null values, data filtering and categorical grouping.
